I am [Mohammad Quanit](https://www.nameslook.com/qanit/) (pronounced as "Ka-nit") and Welcome to my GitHub page. As a seasoned Senior Software Engineer with over 6 years of industry experience, I have passionately delved into the realm of software engineering, where my primary focus has been on mastering the intricacies of JavaScript, Go & Cloud Technologies. 

In addition to my coding endeavors, I also wield my quill to craft technical articles for various esteemed publications. Beyond the written word, I have graced numerous local and international conferences as a tech speaker, sharing insights and sparking discussions on the latest industry trends.

Beyond the codebase, my passions encompass Engineering Management, the art of crafting tailored customer solutions, and the dynamic spheres of Leadership and Mentoring.

<br />


🔭 At present I am actively working with techs like Nodejs, Golang, AWS, and Azure.  <br />
🌱 I’m currently learning Golang Advanced, Rust, Containers, Distributed Systems, Cloud Architecting Design, and High and low-level System Design. <br />
✍🏻 When not immersed in code, I do crafting content for the tech community over at `https://dev.to/mquanit`. <br />
📫 Don't hesitate to reach out to me at `muhammadquanit@gmail.com`. Your thoughts, questions, and ideas are always warmly welcomed. 
<br />

Here's to a journey of continuous learning and collaborative innovation!
